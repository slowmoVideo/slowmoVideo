Description: slow-motion videos from your footage
 slowmoVideo creates smooth slow-motion videos from your footage.
 But it does not simply make your videos play at 0.01× speed.
 You can smoothly slow down and speed up your footage,
 optionally with motion blur. SlowmoVideo tries to find out
 where pixels move in the video (known as the Optical Flow),
 and then uses this information to calculate additional frames
 between the ones recorded by your camera.
 .
 slowmoVideo provides a Qt UI to define the parameters of the
 slow-motion to be calculated, most notably it allows to edit
 the change of speed as time proceeds through bézier curves.
